# Point Spectrum Examples
-------
Point spectrum is more simple file generate for this equipament.

There is 3 types of files possible:

 - Raw files, with \*.gsf extesion
 - Spectra files, with \*.txt extesion
 - Normalized files, with \*.txt extension

## How to open this files?

### 1. Raw files

It is the less processed file for equipament, so it is necessary to all mathematical process.
There is beneficies in this approach, because is this case you can have acess to all of measurements.
In some case maybe is import to acess SNR of every point, so with raw files you can do this.

How to open?

To open this files you need to have 3 files in the same folder, for examples to open second harmonic (02A)

 - "file name" O2A raw.gsf -> *Amplitude interferogram*
 - "file name" O2P raw.gsf -> *Phase interferogram*
 - "file name".html -> *File with informations about measurement*

### 2. Spectra files

### 3. Normalized files
